    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <label class="ridge">
    <p><font color="grey">Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
    <p>The usual scenaio is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of  these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until yo reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state;if you did;t, it isn't. </p>
    <p>Conceptually,you start at the root of a tree; the tree porbably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf . At each node , beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to , and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get a bad leaf, You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice , and trying out the next option in that set of options. if you run out of options,revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>

    <P>This needs an example</P>
    <img src="b.png">
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root , your options area A and B . You Choose A </li><br>
        <li>At A , your C nd D . You chooose C</li><br>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A</li><br>
    <li>At A, you have already tried C , and it failed . Try D</li><br>
    <li>D is bad. Go back to A</li><br>
    <li>At A , you have no options left to try. Go back to Root</li><br>
<li>At Root , you have already tried A. Try B</li><br>
<LI>At B, your options area E and F. Try E</LI><br>
<li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>

    In this example we drew  a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstarct model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is a also a data structure called a tree, but usually we dont have a data structure to tell us what choices we have.(If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-free tree searching).

    <h3>The Backtracking algorithm</h3>
    <font color="blue">
        boolean solve(Node N){
            if n is a leaf node{
              if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            }else{
               for each child c of n{
                     if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                    return false
                }
            }
    </font>
</pre>
    <font color ="grey">
        <p> Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function . This is essential  to understanding the algorithm . If solve(n) is true , that means node n is part of a solution -- that is , node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node.We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false , then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
    </font>
    <h4> How does this work?</h4>
    <font color ="grey">
        <ul>
            <li> If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable</li>
            <li> If no child of n is solvable , then n is not solvable</li>

        </ul>
        <p> Hence , to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path of a goal node), all you have to do is test whether anychild of n is solvable . This is a done recursively , on each child of n . In the above code, this is done by the lines. </p>
    </font>
    <font color="blue">
        <pre>
    for each child c of n {
       if solve (c) succeeds, return true
     }
    return false
</pre>
    </font>
    <font color="grey">
    <p > eventually  the recursion will " bottom" out a leaf node. If the leaf node is goal node,it is solvable, if the leaf node is not a goal  node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code , this is done by the lines.</p>
</font>
<font color="blue">
    <pre>
    if n is a leaf node{
     if the leaf  is a goal node, return true
     else return false
    }
    </pre>
</font>
<font color ="grey">
    <p> The backtracking algorithm is simple but important, You should understand it thoroughly . Another way of stating it is as follows:

    </p>
</font>
<UL>
<LI><h4> To search a tree:</h4></LI>

</UL>
<font color="grey">
    <ol>
        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node</li>
        <Li><p>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have</p>
        <p>searched them all unsuccessfully</p></Li>
    </ol>
</font>
<h4> Non - recursive backtracking , using a stack</h4>
<font color="grey">
    <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm , and any recursive algorithm can be written as a stack algorithm. In fact that is how your recursive algorithms area translated into machine or assembly language</p>

</font>
<pre>
<font color="blue">
    boolean solve (Node n){
      put node n on the stack;
        while the stack is not empty{
         if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
          if it is a goal node, return true
            else pop it off the stack
        }
            else{
              if the node at the top of the stack has untreid children 
                push the next untried child onto the stack
              else pop the node off the stack

        }
       return false
      }
</font>
</pre>
<font color="grey">
    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence , the nodes on the at all times  describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known, that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty),there must have been no goal at all , and no solution to the  problem.</p>
    <p>When the stack algorithm termiantes successfully , the nodes on the on the stack form(in reverse order)a path from the root to a goal  node.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node , the path information is embodied(in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds , the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level , or storing it in a array.</p>
    <p> Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm , modified slightly to print( in reverse order) the nodes along  the successful path:</p>
</font>
<font color="blue">
    <pre>
         boolean solve(Node n){
         if n is a leaf noed {
          if the leaf is a goal node {
            print n 
            return true
          } 
             else return false
         }else {
            for each child c of n{
              if solve (c) succeeds{
                print n
                return true
             }
           }
           return false
         }
      }            
      </pre>
</font>
<h4> Keeping backtracking simple</h4>
<font color="grey">
   <p>All of these versions of the backtracking are pretty simple, but when applies to real problem, they can get pretty  cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p> 
   <p> for example, if the patjh represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions</p>
   <p>to keep the program clean , therefore tests like this should be buries in m ethods. In  a chess game, for example, you could tests whether a node  is a leaf, by writing a<strong>gameOver methods</strong>(or you could even call it <Strong>isLeaf</Strong>.This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.</p>
   <p> Notice that the backtracking algorithms require us to keep track, for each  node on the current path , which of its children have been tried already (so we dont have to try them again ). In the above cod we made this look simple , byjust saying <font color ="black"> <strong> for each child c of n</strong></font>  . In reality , it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through  them. In reality , it may be difficult to figuer out  what the  possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through  them. In chess , for example , a node can represent one repreesnt    one arrangement of pieces on a chessborad , and each child of that node can represnt the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move . How do you  find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examinded? </p>
   <p> The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows : Upon initial entry to the node(that is , when you first get there from above ) , make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list . When the list is empty , there are no remaining untried  children , and you can  return :failure". This is a simple  approach , but it may require quite a lot of additional work.</p>
   <p> There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children . If there is an  ordering , and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p>
   <p> For example, you might be able to number the children <font color="black"><strong> children 1 through n</strong></font> and try them in numerical order. Then , if you have just tried <font color="black"><strong> child k</strong></font> , you know that you have already tried children 1 through<font color="black"><strong> k-1,</strong></font> and you have not yet tried children <font color="black"><strong>k+1</strong></font> through n<font color="black"><strong>n</strong></font>. Or , if you  are trying  to color a map  with just four colors, you can always try <font color="black"><strong> red first ,then yellow, then green, then blue</strong></font>. If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze , you can try choices in the order left , straight , right<font color="black"><strong> (or perhaps north , east , south ,west).</strong></font></p>
   <p> It isnt always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <font color="black"><strong> In the chess game example,</strong></font> you might number your  pieces(Or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in  numerical order , but in addition each piece may also  have several  moves , and these must also be  ordered </p>
   <font color="black"><h4> Example : Tree Search</h4></font>
   <p> For starters , let's do the simplest possible exmaple of backtracking which is    searching which is  saerching an actual tree. W e will also use the  simplest kinf of tree , a bianry tree</p>
   <p> A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated   as theh root node. Each node can refernece (point to) zero , one ,or two other nodes, which area called its children. The children are referred  to as the leaf child and/or the right child . All nodes are reachable ( byone or more  steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles . For our purpose , although this is not  part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say  that a node might or might  not be a goal node, and will contain  its name. The  first example in this chapter( which we  repeat here) shows a binary tree.
   </p>
   <p> Here;s a definition  of the binary Tree class:</p>
   <font color="blue">
    <pre>
     public class Binary Tree
       BinaryTree leftChild = null;
       BinaryTree rightChild = null;
       boolean isGoalNode = false;
       String name;
      BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right,boolean is GoalNode){
        this.name=name;
        leftChild=left;
        rightChild=right;
        this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
      }
    }
    </pre>
   </font>
   <p> Next  we will create a TreeSearch class , and in it we will define a method makeTree()  which constructs the above bianry tree.</p>
   <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    static BinaryTree make Tree(){
      BinaryTree root a, b, c, d, e ,f ;
      c=new BinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
      d=new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
      e=new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
      f=new BinaryTree("F",null,null,false);
      a=new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
      b=new BinaryTree("B", e,f false); 
      root= new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
      return root;
    }
    </pre>
   </font>
   <p> Here's a main program to create a bianry tree and try to solve it:</p>
   <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    public static void main(String args[]){
      BinaryTree tree= makeTree();
      System.out.println(solvable(tree));
     }
    </pre>
   </font>
   <P> And finally,here's the recursive routine to "solve " the bianry tree  by finding a goal node.</P>
   <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    static boolean solvable(Binary Tree node){
    /*1*/ if(node == null) return false;
    /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
    /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
    /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
    /*5*/ return false
    
}
</pre>
</font>
   <P> here's what the numbered lines are doing:</P>
   <ol>
    <li>If we  are given a null node , its not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
    <li> If the node we are given is a goal node , return success.</li>
    <li> See if the left child of node is solvable , and if so , conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node says to</li>
    <li> Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
    <li> Since neither child of node is solvable , node itself is not solvable.</li>
   </ol>
   <p> This program runs correctly  and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
   <p> Each time we ask fror another  node , we have to check if it is null. In the above we put the first thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first  </p>
   <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    static boolean solvable(Binary Tree node){

      if (node.isGoalNode) return true;

      if (node.leftChild!=null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;

    if (node.rightChild!=null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;

    return false;

    }
    </pre>

   </font>
   <p> I think the first version is simpler , but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
   <hr>
   <font color="black"><h4>What are the children?</h4></font>
<p> One of the things that simplifies the above bianry tree search is that , at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices.Previous choices dont give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know ,both the left and theright child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately , without recursion.</p>
<p>  Consider , for example , the problem of four-coloring a map, .It is a theorem of mathematics that map on a palne, no matter  how conoluted the countries ar e, can be colored with at  most four colors , so that  no two countries  that share a border are the  same color.</p>
<p> To color a mao, you chooose a color for the first country , then a color for the second country , and so on , until all countreis are  colored.</p>
<p>There  are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Method 1 . Try each of the four possible colors , and recur.When you run out of countries , check whether you at goal node.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Method 2. Try only thode colors that have not already  been used for an adjacent country , adn recur . If and when you run out of  countries , you have successfully colored the map.</li>

</ul>
<P> Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be solvable ; after all a  checkboard only needs two colors.
     </P>

     <font color="black" ><strong><p> boolean mapIsOK()</p></strong></font>
     <P> Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly  </P>
     <font color="black"><strong><P>booleanokToColor(int row,int column,int color)</P></strong></font>
   <p> Used by method 2 to check , at every node , whether there is adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p>
   <font color="black"><strong><p> int[]nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</p></strong></font>
   <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country"(actually,the row and column of the  next sqaure on the checkerboard).</p>
   <p> Here's  the code for methods 1:</p>

   <font color="blue">
<pre>
     boolean explore1(int row,int column , int color){
       if(row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOk();
       map[row][column] =color;
     for(int nextColor=RED;nextColor<=BLUE; nextColor++){
        int[] next=nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
        if(explore1(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
     }
       return false;
   }
    </pre>
   </font>
   <p> And here's the code for method 2:</p>
   <font color="blue"> 
    <pre>
    boolean explore2(int row, int column,int color){
     if(row>= NUM_ROWS)return true;
     if(okToColor(row, column, color)){
       map[row][column] =color;
       for(int nextColor=RED;nextColor<=BLUE; nextColor++){
        int[] next=nextRowAndColumn(row,column);
        if(explore1(next[0],next[1],nextColor)) return true;
      }
     }   
      return false;
    }
</pre>   
</font>
   <p> Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good.However , the timing suggests otherwise: </p>
   <center>
    <font color="black">
   <table border="2">
    <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td bgcolor="grey"> 2 by 3 map </td>
    <td bgcolor="grey">3 by 3 map </td>
    <td bgcolor="grey"> 3 by 4 map</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td bgcolor="grey" >Method 1:</td>
    <td>60 ms.</td>
    <td> 940 ms.</td>
    <td> 60530ms.(1 minute)</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td bgcolor="grey"> Method 2:</td>
    <td> 0ms.</td>
    <td> 0ms.</td>
    <td>0ms.</td>
</tr>
   </table>
</font>
</center>
<p> The zeros in the above table indicate times too short  to measure (less than 1 milliseond). Why this huge differenc ? Either ofthese methods could have exonential growth . Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its secensdants, and thsi will  often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting  to check until a leaf node is reached ,exponential growth is peractically  guaranteed . If there is any way to eliminate children (reducethe set of choices ), do so ! </p>

<p> Often our first try at a program doesn't work , and we need to debug it . Debuggers are helpful , but sometimes we need to fall  back on the inserting print statements. There are  some tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be  applied to any porgram to any program , but are especially useful when yu are trying  to debug recursive  routines.</p>

<p> Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must .Also , remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself  contain bugs , or (in the worst case) can affect the results , so be very careful code inserted  for debugging purpose can itself  contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results , so b e very careful with it .</p>
<p> here's our debugginbg code. For this trivial program , there's almost  more debugging code than actual code , but in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>

    <h4>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements</h4>

 </font>
 <P>Writing debugging statements is progamming , too . Oftenits  as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is debug the actual program. Once your program is working , why throw this code away?</P>
 <P>Obviously , you dont want to  print out all this debugging  information  from a program you are ready to submit(or to turn over to  your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. Whats more . in the above example , you would have to replace every return (yes(node)) with return (true) , and every  return (no(node)) with return false. With all these changes , you might  introduce newbugs into your  program.</P>
 <p> The simple solution is to make your  debugging  statements conditional. fOR example,</p>

    <pre>
    static final boolean debugging=false;


    static void  enter(Binary Tree node){

            <p> In industry , actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging, Don;t worry too much about your ocde larger; modern  compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final , it can never be true , and the controlled code will be discarded.</p>

            <P> If an exception is thrown , oyu can get inforamtion about  just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other , you can create and thrwo your own Exceptions.However , Java programmers dont always realize that you can create an exception wihtout throwing it . For exammple , the following code.</P>

            <p> The backtracking method is named  solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a  leaf, which in this case means a postition means a  positoin from which no further moves are possible . This isnt so easy
                <p> Now to the program  . The  main program  will initialize te board , and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle . The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a writing path , or it will fail and then mian program will have to  print out the bad news</p>

                <p > The backtracking method is named solvable adn returns a boolean  in solvable we s hall need to check whether we are at a leaf,  which in this casse means a  position from which no further moves , are possible . This isnt so easy.</p>
                <p> Each possible  move will result in a new board position , and these new board positons are the children of hte current board  positoin , Hnence to find the children of a node (that is , of a board postion ) , we need only fin dthe possible moves  form that node . Remeber that it is  also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
                <p> Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress , we must analyze the game to some extent . probably a number of apporaches would work , and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle , you might  find a different but equally valid approach.</p>
                <P>First , notice that if a marble has a move, that moves is unique , if it can move ahead one square , then it cannot jump.If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one sqaure. Thid suggests, that ,  to find the possible moves , we might assign numbers to the marbles , and checl each marblein turn . When we have looked at all marbles , we have looked at all possiblemoves . This would require having a atable to keep track of where each marble is , or else somehow "marking " each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want.Neither alternative is very attractive.   </P>
                <p> Next notice , that for a given position , each marble requires   a unique space. Hence, isntead of talking  about moving a  particular marble , we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space.If a move is possible from a given space , then  that must be the only  move possible from that space , because if the marble in that space has a move,it is unique.There is a slight complication because not every contains a marble , but at least the spaces(unlike the marbles)stay in one place.</p>
<font color="black">
                <div > Now we  have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program .Just check , in order , the 2n+1 spaces of the board .For each space ,either zero or one move is possible. With this understanding , we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board,int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</div>
            </font>

            <ul>
                <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
                <li> If the position contains a black marble , the method cheks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
                <li> If the position contains a white marble , the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>

            </ul>

            <p> We write another method <strong> int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard , int position)</strong> that will take a board and a position , make a move from that position , and return as its value a new board.(We could write this somewhat  more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one , but here we are more concerned with simplicity .)In technical  jargon , makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative".</p>
